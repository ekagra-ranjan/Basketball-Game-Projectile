### A Short Story about this Game:

This project was done after the boards of class X to implement the laws of projectile motion and to supposedly make a game as cool as Angry Birds ;) This project started when making video games was my hobby. Later I realised that I didn't have enough time to finish it and when I did get time, I realised that my love for Web Developement had faded away :(
